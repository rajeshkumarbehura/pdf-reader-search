# Using LLM, Postgres VectorDB, and OpenAI to Perform Semantic Search on PDF Documents

### Description
The goal of this project is to build a prototype app that can perform 
similarity search on PDF documents using VectorSearch (Postgres). 
The app will use the Langchain llm framework 
and OpenAI to extract and compare semantic vectors from the PDFs.

### TechStack
1. Postgres
2. OpenAI (account with apikey)
3. Langchain LLM
4. Python

This is a basic scenario to test and practice vector search with Postgres.
